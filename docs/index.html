Things are out of joint in the delta of the Mekong, Southeast Asia’s largest river. Rising sea levels and subsiding land are threatening to flood the area.</div><br/><div class="lede lede-a"><p>
Simultaneously, the annual Monsoon inundations are delayed more and more often, while still retreating early, and leaving local fields parched.</p><p>But why? Let’s unravel a complex tangle of reasons, with climate change at its core.</p></div><p>
Deltas have always been hubs of human development. Ancient civilizations flourished in the Nile and the Ganges deltas. Today, <a text="half a billion people" url="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news">half a billion people</a> call deltas home—even though they cover only 1% of the earth’s land surface. With rich crops and abundant fish, deltas are crucial to food security and economic development.</p><p>However, deltas are also extremely vulnerable.</p><p>Located at the intersection of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, a delta’s entire existence depends on a delicate balance of factors: Temperature. Freshwater and saltwater. Precipitation and river flow.</p><p>In the Mekong delta, this balance has been disturbed. As a consequence, the delta of Southeast Asia’s largest river is both sinking and drying out at the same time. While ever-rising waves lap away at the coastline, and higher sea levels push salty water into the delta, severe droughts are leaving the landscape parched.</p><p>But what exactly causes this double threat? And what can be done about it?</p><p>The answers to these questions are as complex as the environmental and political problems casting their shadows over the region.</p><p>At the heart of the issue: Climate change.</p><h2 id="living-with-the-river">Living with the River</h2><p>Springing from the vast Tibetan plateau at the foot of the Himalayas, the Mekong river winds its way over 2,700 miles through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.</p></div><div class="parametric-graphic " style="max-width:960px;margin:1em auto"><div class="parametric-graphic-hed">The Mekong River and its Delta</div><div class="parametric-graphic-subhed">From the Tibetan plateau through six countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam</div><img style="width:100%;height:auto;max-height:none" src="static/images/overview.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><div class="parametric-graphic-source"><div class="parametric-graphic-source-label-wrapper"><div class="parametric-graphic-source-label">SOURCE</div><div class="parametric-graphic-source-citation">Christina Orieschnig</div></div><div class="parametric-graphic-source-watermark">Parametric Press</div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><br/></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="height:100vh;top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><div style="width:100vw;height:100vh;transition:opacity 1s;display:flex;flex-direction:row;align-items:center;background-size:cover" idyll="[object Object]"><img style="width:100vw;height:auto;max-height:none" src="static/images/35_lq.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><p>At Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh, the river splits into branches that fan out over the fertile delta plains, defining the landscapes of southern Cambodia and Vietnam.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>On these floodplains, both biodiversity and agriculture flourish.

The flood was too short to infiltrate deeply into the soil, leaving it thirsty for irrigation.

Satellite rain measurements over the Mekong basin show that macro-scale precipitation distribution in 2019 differed significantly from previous years.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
The torrential Monsoon rains in the catchment area of the Mekong, which generally set in towards the end of May, were sparse in the spring and early summer of 2019.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>Meteorological experts trace the immediate cause for this back to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Approximately occurring every four years, El Niño is a global weather event with impacts on local weather. It is caused by a change in temperature distributions in the Pacific Ocean. Oceanic and atmospheric conditions interact to invert the usual east-west direction of ocean surface winds. Now blowing from west to east, they drive warm equatorial waters towards the eastern Pacific. This, in turn, has impacts on weather patterns such as the Monsoon rains over Southeast Asia.</p></div><div class="parametric-graphic " style="max-width:720px;margin:1em auto"><div class="parametric-graphic-hed">Yearly rainfall in the Mekong basin since 1981</div><div class="parametric-graphic-subhed">In El Niño years, there is generally less cumulative rainfall in the river basin.

So far, measurements based on satellite data and gauges from across the world, indicate that the average sea level has <a text="increased by 7–8 inches" url="https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/coastal/sea-level-rise" href="https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/coastal/sea-level-rise">increased by 7–8 inches</a> since 1900.

Based on calculations using a refined elevation model, the scientists discovered that the average elevation of the Mekong delta is only 2.6 feet above sea level.</p><p>A sea level rise of 3.3 feet until 2100, as projected by NOAA, would flood the Vietnamese part of the delta entirely and displace over 18 million people.</p><p>In addition to these global developments, local factors are also influencing how coastal regions will be affected by rising sea levels. In some areas, tectonic movements are actually raising land faster than sea levels rise. This is the case in southeast Alaska, where the local sea levels are falling.</p><p>In other regions, such as the Mekong delta, the reverse is true.</p><p>While the sea is rising, the land is also sinking due to a process called subsidence. In this process, a landscape loses elevation either because sediments are being compacted, or because subterranean voids collapse. These voids can either exist naturally, such as cave systems in limestone, or result from human activities like oil, sand, or groundwater extraction.</p><p>In the Mekong delta, some land subsidence is natural, caused by tectonics and the settling of sediments deposited by the river since the last Ice Age. The majority, however, can be traced back to human activities.</p><p>The expanding infrastructure of the urban centers in the region is heavy, literally putting pressure on the delta and accelerating compaction. At the same time, the groundwater bodies in the Vietnamese Mekong delta are among the most heavily exploited in the world.</p><p>After Vietnam’s transition to a market economy in 1986, economic growth increased the need for water. Groundwater is used for <a text="domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes" url="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/8/084010/pdf" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/8/084010/pdf">domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes</a>.</p><p>In 2017, a study using a 3D hydro-geological model found that over the past 25 years, the land has <a text="sunk by an average of 7 inches" url="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7146/pdf" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7146/pdf">sunk by an average of 7 inches</a>. Currently, around 660 million gallons of groundwater are being extracted from the Vietnamese Mekong delta every single day.</p><p>Subsidence due to groundwater extraction is extremely dangerous because it continues even after the end of the practice. A 2020 study found that even when stopping all groundwater extraction as quickly as possible, and implementing mitigation measures, the land would <a text="lose at least another 6 inches of elevation until 2100" url="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ab5e21/pdf" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ab5e21/pdf">lose at least another 6 inches of elevation until 2100</a>.</p><p>Far from being reduced, groundwater extraction increases by 4% every year. If unchecked, the subsidence by the end of the century could tally in at over three feet.</p><p>Again, rising sea levels and land subsidence are not the only elements in the equation. They are tightly interlinked with other aspects of global warming and power generation.</p><p>Higher temperatures and more frequent droughts have increased the demand for irrigation, in turn revving up the groundwater extraction rate.</p><p>Dams not only hold water back in upstream reservoirs, but also trap sediment. This sediment would usually be deposited on the floodplains, somewhat counteracting subsidence.</p><p>Economic interests are also eating away at the delta. According to <a text="recent research published in Nature" url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53804-z" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53804-z">recent research published in Nature</a>, sand is being extracted at record rates from the delta. Enormous amounts are used to produce concrete for infrastructure development.</p><p>All this leaves the Mekong delta set to disappear beneath the waves.</p><p>Already, effects are felt today: Storm floods are sweeping across the delta ever more frequently, and much farther inland than before. The coastline, renowned for its beauty and a popular tourist destination, is slowly eroding away. Salty seawater encroaches into the river system, tilting the balance in ecosystems, and threatening agriculture and freshwater fisheries.</p><p>A UN report released in February 2020 <a text="outlines the threats" url="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Mekong%20Delta%20Drough%20and%20Saltwater%20Intrusion_Joint%20Assessment%20Report_Feb%202020.pdf" href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Mekong%20Delta%20Drough%20and%20Saltwater%20Intrusion_Joint%20Assessment%20Report_Feb%202020.pdf">outlines the threats</a> of the compound effects of droughts and saltwater intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. It also warns of the destructive societal impacts, ranging from children being pulled out of school, to a sharp rise in poverty rates. In a worst-case scenario, estimates in February said, saltwater would intrude up to 44 miles inland.</p><p>But by mid-March, the <a text="situation had deteriorated even further" url="https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/viet-nam-drought-and-saltwater-intrusion-office-resident-coordinator-flash-update-1" href="https://reliefweb.int/report/viet-nam/viet-nam-drought-and-saltwater-intrusion-office-resident-coordinator-flash-update-1">situation had deteriorated even further</a>, and saltwater intrusion reached 68s miles inland—19 miles further than the previous maximum. As a result, almost 40,000 hectares of rice paddies were destroyed. When the crisis peaked in early April, over 95,000 households were affected, experiencing shortages of drinking water or even a total lack thereof.</p><p>Faced with such current reminders of the fragility of the situation, the future gives cause for worry.</p><h2 id="what-will-the-future-hold?">What Will the Future Hold?</h2><p>The degree to which the present crisis in the Mekong delta will morph into a future catastrophe is not yet certain. Many of the projections on which future scenarios are based are still wide open to human influence, on a local, regional, and global level.</p><p>Locally, many communes in the delta are arming against droughts and salinity intrusion through infrastructure developments. They are constructing sluice gates to restrict the inflow of salty water during the dry season, and extending water distribution systems. Farmers are increasingly also switching their crops to drought- and salt-resistant varieties.</p><p>On a regional and national level, measures could be taken to tackle the problems at their sources. Reducing the rates of groundwater extractions to restrict land subsidence, developing information campaigns, emergency plans, and regulations to coordinate irrigation and reduce saltwater intrusions are all <a text="steps that have been suggested" url="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-needs-to-act-in-mekong-delta-as-land-sinking-seas-rising-experts-4005471.html" href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-needs-to-act-in-mekong-delta-as-land-sinking-seas-rising-experts-4005471.html">steps that have been suggested</a>. The adverse effects of the upstream dams might be mitigated through diplomacy.</p><p>Unfortunately, economic interests still largely outweigh the political will for such measures.</p><p>Ultimately, the future of the delta also hinges on the willingness of the international community to commit to combating global warming by reducing emissions. Even if all possible measures were taken in the Mekong delta itself, sea-level rise could still result in the delta’s disappearance, if not limited by international action.</p><p>Some consequences have already become irreversible, such as a certain amount of land subsidence, or a globally <a text="increased frequency of El Niño events" url="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3351" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3351">increased frequency of El Niño events</a>.</p><p>But right now, there is still a chance to create a sustainable future for the Mekong delta and its inhabitants. The question is whether the delta’s inhabitants, its political leaders, and the global community as a whole are willing and able to take the steps needed to grasp this chance.</p><div class="parametric-author-bio" style="font-family:Graphik Web;font-size:16px;font-weigth:600px;line-height:1.5;margin:3em 0 2em"><p><b><a href="http://typingquill.com/">Christina Orieschnig</a></b> is a PhD researcher in hydrology, working in the Cambodian Mekong Delta.
